## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This app also incorporates the usage of Moment.js to display the date and time. 

## Usage
The user can utilize the Work Day Scheduler app to organize and store the daily tasks they may encouter during a typical workday from 8am - 5pm. The scheduler allows the user to enter and save a task in each hour block. The blocks are color-coded dependent on the hour to let the user know which events have passed (grey), are currently happening (red) and are upcoming (green). 

When the user inputs a new event into the time block, the event will be saved into local storage by clicking the save button to the right of each time slot. When the user refreshes the page, the events previously entered will remain as the color on the time blocks will be updated with each hour.
